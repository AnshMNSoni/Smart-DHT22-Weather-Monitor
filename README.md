### 🌐 Wiring Diagram:

#### 👉 DHT22 Sensor:
- VCC -> 5V <br/>
- GND -> GND <br/>
- Data -> Pin 2 (Digital Pin) <br/>

#### 👉 LCD Display:
- VCC -> 5V <br/>
- GND -> GND <br/>
- SDA -> A4 (on most Arduino boards like Uno) <br/>
- SCL -> A5 (on most Arduino boards like Uno) <br/>

#### 👉 Push Buttons:
- Red Button -> Pin 7 (for mode toggle) <br/>
- Blue Button -> Pin 5 (for showing readings) <br/>

### 🌐 How to Use:
1️⃣ Upload the Code: Open the code in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino. <br/>

2️⃣ Power the Arduino: Connect the Arduino to your power source (e.g., USB or external power supply). <br/>

3️⃣ Interact with Buttons: <br/>
- Press the Red Button to toggle between Mode 1 and Mode 2.
- Press the Blue Button to display the temperature and humidity readings.
- View the Output: The LCD will display the readings for 1 second and then return to the main menu.

### 🌐 Notes:
1️⃣ Ensure your wiring is correct to avoid any issues with sensor readings. <br/>

2️⃣ The DHT22 sensor might take a few seconds to stabilize and give accurate readings. <br/>

3️⃣ You can adjust the delay times in the code to change how long the readings are displayed. <br/>
